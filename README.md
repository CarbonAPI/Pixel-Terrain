# Pixel-Terrain
ROBLOX Plugin to create custom pixel-esque terrain.

Insert the Plugin.lua file into ServerScriptService and put the modulescript inside of that lua file. There is also a ScreenGui under the plugin script.

Note that the demo file will not work standalone and will require you to upload it as a plugin.
